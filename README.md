### Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario:
There are many factors may influence the profit of a supermarket. For instance, the pricing, location, customer volume, hiring cost. Suppose there is a company that wants to start a supermarket chain in a city and they have already known the residentâ€™s income level. This simulation could be used to help them decide the size, price level, location and how many supermarkets to open in this city to maximize the profit.

### Hypotheses: 

1. The best size and amount of supermarkets to be started is related to the population and income level.
2. Making the markets evenly distributed throughout the city is more profitable.
